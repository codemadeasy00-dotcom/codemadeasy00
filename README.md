# Welcome to My Project ðŸš€

Hi there!  
Iâ€™m a 2nd-year B.Tech CSE student exploring software development and sharing my learning journey through projects like this. The goal of this repository is to practice writing clean, maintainable code while experimenting with modern tools and technologies.  

This project is not just about solving a problemâ€”itâ€™s also about improving coding habits, collaborating with others, and documenting progress in a way thatâ€™s useful for both peers and recruiters.  

Iâ€™d love for you to check out the work here, share feedback, or even contribute if youâ€™re interested. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope this project sparks ideas or helps you in your own learning path.
